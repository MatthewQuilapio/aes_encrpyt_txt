# Self made AES Encrypt Text

This project should encrypt text file into AES format. But it is just a prototype version. 

## How it is made:

Tech used: C++

C++ is used because I wanted to practice more in C++ programming and for faster running.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate the emulation of AES encryption.
- Demonstrate the use for vector functions in C++.
